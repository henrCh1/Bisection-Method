# Bisection-Method
本程序使用Python编写，采用二分法求解非线性方程的根。二分法又称为对分区间法或对分法，是最简单的求根方法之一，属于区间法求根类型。该方法利用连续函数的零点定理，逐步将含有根的区间减半来构造点列，以逼近根。通过修改相关参数和重新定义方程组，可以实现指定精度下的线性方程组求解。代码中有详细注释，以便您更好地理解其内容。/
This program is written in Python and uses the bisection method to find the roots of nonlinear equations. The bisection method, also known as the interval halving method or dichotomy, is one of the simplest methods for finding roots and belongs to the interval-based root-finding type. This method uses the zero-point theorem of continuous functions to gradually halve the interval containing the root to construct a sequence of points that approach the root. By modifying relevant parameters and redefining equation groups, linear equation systems can be solved with specified precision. The code contains detailed comments to help you better understand its content.
